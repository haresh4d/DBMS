# Student-Course Management Database

This project provides SQL scripts to create and populate a sample relational database for managing departments, students, courses, faculty, and their relationships within an educational institution.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `create_tables.sql` – Defines the schema with tables, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- `insert_data.sql` – Inserts sample data into all tables for testing and demonstration.

## 🧱 Database Schema Overview

The database includes the following tables:

- **departments**: Contains department details.
- **students**: Contains student information including department association.
- **courses**: Contains course offerings with credit information.
- **faculty**: Contains faculty information including department association.
- **course_faculty**: Many-to-many mapping between courses and faculty (with semester info).
- **enrollments**: Tracks which students are enrolled in which courses, their semester, and grades.

## ✅ Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have a MySQL or compatible SQL database installed.
2. Run `create_tables.sql` to create the schema:
   ```bash
   mysql -u <username> -p < your_database < create_tables.sql
````

3. Run `insert_data.sql` to populate the database:

   ```bash
   mysql -u <username> -p < your_database < insert_data.sql
   ```

## 📊 Sample Data

The dataset includes:

* 20 departments
* 20+ students with varied department affiliations
* 20+ courses including theory and lab sessions
* 20+ faculty members
* Course-faculty mapping across semesters
* Sample enrollment records with grades

## 🔍 Use Cases

This database can be used for:

* Academic management system demos
* SQL practice and learning joins, constraints, and normalization
* Developing student/faculty portals
* Project work for database or software engineering courses
